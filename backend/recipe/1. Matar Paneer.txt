Ingredients:
- 200 grams of paneer (Indian cottage cheese)
- 1 cup of green peas (fresh or frozen)
- 2 large tomatoes
- 1 large onion
- 2 green chilies
- 1 inch piece of ginger
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon of red chili powder
- 1 teaspoon of garam masala
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
- Salt to taste
- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish

Step 1:
Start by preparing the ingredients. Chop the tomatoes, onion, green chilies, ginger, and garlic. Cut the paneer into cubes. If you are using frozen peas, thaw them before use.

Step 2:
Heat the vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Then add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.

Step 3:
Add the chopped green chilies, ginger, and garlic to the pan and sauté for another minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the spices are well blended.

Step 4:
Add the green peas to the pan and cook for a few minutes until they are tender. Then add the paneer cubes and garam masala. Mix well so that the paneer and peas are coated with the tomato and spice mixture. Cover the pan and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.

Step 5:
Check the seasoning and adjust if necessary. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves before serving. Your Matar Paneer is ready to be served with rice or roti. Enjoy this delicious North Indian dish!
