Ingredients:
- 2 medium-sized potatoes
- 1 large capsicum (bell pepper)
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 large onion
- 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon of red chili powder
- Salt to taste
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish

Step 1:
Peel the potatoes and cut them into small cubes. Wash the capsicum, remove the seeds and cut it into small pieces. Peel and finely chop the garlic and onion.

Step 2:
Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Then add the chopped garlic and onion to the pan. Saut√© until the onions become translucent.

Step 3:
Add the cubed potatoes to the pan. Stir well to ensure the potatoes are coated with the oil and spices. Cover the pan and let the potatoes cook for about 10 minutes, or until they are half-cooked. Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the pan.

Step 4:
Add the chopped capsicum, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt to the pan. Stir well to mix the spices with the vegetables. Cover the pan and let it cook for another 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are cooked to your liking. Stir occasionally to ensure the vegetables are evenly cooked.

Step 5:
Once the vegetables are cooked, turn off the heat. Garnish the stir fry with fresh coriander leaves. Serve the Potato and Capsicum Stir Fry hot as a side dish or as a main course with rice or bread. Enjoy your meal!
