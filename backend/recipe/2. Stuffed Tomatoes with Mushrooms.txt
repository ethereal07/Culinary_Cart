Step 1
Start by preheating your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. While the oven is heating, prepare your tomatoes. Choose 4 large, ripe tomatoes and cut off the tops. Use a spoon to carefully hollow out the insides, making sure not to puncture the skin. Set the hollowed tomatoes aside.

Step 2
Next, prepare your filling. Chop up 1 large onion and 2 cups of mushrooms. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they become translucent. Then, add the mushrooms and cook until they are soft and have released their juices. 

Step 3
Once the mushrooms and onions are cooked, remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in 1 cup of breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix until all the ingredients are well combined.

Step 4
Now, it's time to stuff the tomatoes. Spoon the mushroom and onion mixture into the hollowed-out tomatoes, filling them to the top. Place the stuffed tomatoes in a baking dish.

Step 5
Bake the stuffed tomatoes in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the tomatoes are tender and the filling is golden brown. Let them cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your Stuffed Tomatoes with Mushrooms as a delicious and healthy meal.
