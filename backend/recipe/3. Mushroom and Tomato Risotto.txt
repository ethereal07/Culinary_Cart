Step 1
Start by preparing all the ingredients. You will need 1 cup of Arborio rice, 4 cups of vegetable or chicken broth, 2 cups of sliced mushrooms, 1 cup of diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup of white wine, and 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese. Also, prepare 1 diced onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic for extra flavor.

Step 2
In a large saucepan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the pan and sauté until they become translucent. This should take about 5 minutes.

Step 3
Add the sliced mushrooms to the pan and continue to sauté until they are browned and tender. This should take another 5-7 minutes. Then, add the Arborio rice to the pan and stir it around to coat it in the oil and flavors.

Step 4
Pour in the white wine and let it simmer until the liquid has mostly evaporated. Then, begin adding the broth one cup at a time, stirring constantly. Allow each cup of broth to be absorbed before adding the next. This process should take about 20-25 minutes.

Step 5
Once all the broth has been absorbed and the rice is tender, stir in the diced tomatoes and grated parmesan cheese. Continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes until everything is heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then serve your mushroom and tomato risotto hot. Enjoy this creamy and comforting dish!
