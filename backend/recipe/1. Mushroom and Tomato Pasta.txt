Step 1
Start by gathering all your ingredients. You will need pasta (any type you prefer), fresh mushrooms, ripe tomatoes, olive oil, garlic cloves, and parmesan cheese. Also, ensure you have salt and pepper for seasoning.

Step 2
Cook your pasta according to the instructions on the package. While the pasta is cooking, you can start preparing the sauce. Heat a large pan over medium heat and add a generous amount of olive oil.

Step 3
Peel and finely chop your garlic cloves. Add them to the pan and sauté until they become fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic as it can become bitter. 

Step 4
Wash and slice your mushrooms and tomatoes. Add them to the pan with the garlic and sauté until the mushrooms are browned and the tomatoes have softened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Step 5
Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the pan with the mushrooms and tomatoes. Toss everything together until the pasta is well coated in the sauce. Grate some parmesan cheese over the top and serve immediately. Enjoy your Mushroom and Tomato Pasta!
