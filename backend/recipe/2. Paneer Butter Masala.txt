Instructions:

[Step 1]
Start by preparing the paneer. If you're using store-bought paneer, cut it into cubes. If you're making it from scratch, follow the instructions on the package. Set the paneer aside.

[Step 2]
Next, prepare the gravy. In a large pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add 1 finely chopped onion and sauté until it turns golden brown. Add 2 teaspoons of ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute.

[Step 3]
Add 2 cups of pureed tomatoes to the pan and mix well. Cook for about 10 minutes, or until the tomato puree loses its raw smell. Add 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1 teaspoon of coriander powder, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook for another 2-3 minutes.

[Step 4]
Add the paneer cubes to the pan and mix well, ensuring that all the cubes are coated with the gravy. Cover the pan and let it simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the paneer is cooked and has absorbed some of the flavors from the gravy.

[Step 5]
Finally, add 1 cup of cream to the pan and mix well. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until the gravy becomes thick and creamy. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot with naan or rice.
