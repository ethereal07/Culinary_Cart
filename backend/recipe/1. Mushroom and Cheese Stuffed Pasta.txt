Step 1
Start by preheating your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). While the oven is heating, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add your large pasta shells or lasagna sheets and cook them according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside to cool.

Step 2
While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and once it's hot, add 1 pound of sliced mushrooms. Sauté the mushrooms until they are browned and have released their liquid, about 5-7 minutes. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

Step 3
In a large bowl, combine the sautéed mushrooms, 1 cup of ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese, 1 beaten egg, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix everything together until well combined.

Step 4
Take your cooked pasta shells or lasagna sheets and stuff them with the mushroom and cheese mixture. If you're using lasagna sheets, you'll need to spread the mixture over the sheet and then roll it up to create a tube.

Step 5
Place the stuffed pasta in a baking dish and cover with your favorite marinara sauce. Sprinkle the top with additional parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the pasta cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your Mushroom and Cheese Stuffed Pasta!
