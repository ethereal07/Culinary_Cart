Step 1
Start by gathering all your ingredients. You will need 1 pound of fresh mushrooms, 1 medium onion, 2 cloves of garlic, 2 cups of milk, 1 cup of cream, salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs and spices. Some good options include thyme, rosemary, or parsley.

Step 2
Prepare your vegetables. Clean the mushrooms with a damp cloth and slice them thinly. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic.

Step 3
Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of oil or butter, then add the chopped onion and garlic. Saut√© until the onions are translucent and the garlic is fragrant. Add the sliced mushrooms and continue to cook until they are browned and have released their juices.

Step 4
Once the mushrooms are cooked, add the milk and cream to the pot. Stir well to combine, then reduce the heat to low. Allow the soup to simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will allow the flavors to meld together.

Step 5
Season the soup with salt, pepper, and your chosen herbs and spices. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If you prefer a smoother soup, you can use an immersion blender to puree it directly in the pot. Serve the soup hot, garnished with a sprinkle of fresh herbs or a drizzle of cream. Enjoy your creamy mushroom soup!
