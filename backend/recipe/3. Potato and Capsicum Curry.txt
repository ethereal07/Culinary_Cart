Step 1
Start by gathering all the necessary ingredients for the curry. You will need 2 large potatoes, 2 capsicums, 2 onions, 2 tomatoes, 2 green chilies, 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds, 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1 teaspoon of coriander powder, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, salt to taste, 2 tablespoons of oil, and fresh coriander leaves for garnishing.

Step 2
Peel the potatoes and cut them into small cubes. Wash the capsicums, remove the seeds and cut them into small pieces. Finely chop the onions, tomatoes, and green chilies.

Step 3
Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter. Then add the chopped onions and green chilies to the pan. Saut√© until the onions become translucent.

Step 4
Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan and cook until they become soft. Then add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. Mix well and cook for a few minutes until the spices are well blended with the tomatoes.

Step 5
Add the cubed potatoes and chopped capsicum to the pan. Stir well to coat the vegetables with the spice mixture. Cover the pan and let it cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked through and the capsicum is tender. Stir occasionally to prevent the curry from sticking to the pan. Add salt to taste and garnish with fresh coriander leaves before serving. Your Potato and Capsicum Curry is ready to be served with rice or naan bread.
