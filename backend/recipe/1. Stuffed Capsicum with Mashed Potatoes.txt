Step 1
Start by preheating your oven to 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit). While the oven is heating, wash 4 large capsicums and cut off the tops. Remove the seeds and membranes from inside, creating a hollow space for the filling. Set the capsicums aside.

Step 2
Next, prepare the mashed potatoes. Peel and dice 4 large potatoes. Place them in a large pot and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes until they are tender, which should take about 15-20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.

Step 3
Add 1/4 cup of milk, 2 tablespoons of butter, and salt and pepper to taste to the pot with the potatoes. Mash the potatoes until they are smooth and creamy. If the potatoes are too dry, add more milk as needed.

Step 4
Stir in 1 cup of grated cheese, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder into the mashed potatoes. Mix until the cheese is melted and the spices are well incorporated.

Step 5
Spoon the mashed potato mixture into the hollowed-out capsicums, filling them to the top. Place the stuffed capsicums in a baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the capsicums are tender and the filling is golden brown. Serve the stuffed capsicums hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.
