Step 1
Gather all the necessary ingredients. You will need 200 grams of paneer (cottage cheese), 2 large onions, 2 large tomatoes, 2 tablespoons of butter, 1 teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1/2 cup of fresh cream, salt to taste, and fresh coriander leaves for garnishing.

Step 2
Start by preparing the base for the gravy. Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown. Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another minute. Then, add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they are soft and mushy. Once done, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool. Once cooled, blend this mixture into a smooth paste using a blender.

Step 3
In the same pan, melt another tablespoon of butter. Add the blended paste back into the pan. Add the red chili powder, garam masala, and turmeric powder. Mix well and cook for a few minutes until the spices are well blended with the paste.

Step 4
Cut the paneer into cubes and add them to the pan. Mix gently, ensuring all the paneer cubes are coated with the gravy. Cover the pan and let it simmer for about 10 minutes on low heat.

Step 5
Finally, add the fresh cream and salt to the pan. Mix well and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves before serving. Your Paneer Butter Masala is ready to be served. Enjoy it with naan, roti, or rice.
