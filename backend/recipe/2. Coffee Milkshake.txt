Instructions:
        [Step 1]
        Start by brewing your coffee. You can use any method you prefer, but make sure it's strong. Once it's done, let it cool down to room temperature.

        [Step 2]
        Once your coffee has cooled, pour it into a blender. Add 2 cups of milk, 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, and 2 tablespoons of sugar. 

        [Step 3]
        Blend the mixture on high speed until it's smooth and frothy. This should take about 1-2 minutes. If you want your milkshake to be thicker, you can add more ice cream and blend again.

        [Step 4]
        Pour your milkshake into a tall glass. If you want to make it extra indulgent, top it with a dollop of whipped cream.

        [Step 5]
        Finish off your coffee milkshake with a sprinkle of cocoa powder on top of the whipped cream. Serve immediately and enjoy your refreshing and energizing drink!
