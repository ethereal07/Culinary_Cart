Step 1
Start by gathering all the necessary ingredients for the recipe. You will need 500 grams of okra (also known as ladies finger), 2 large onions, 4 cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of sugar, salt to taste, and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. 

Step 2
Prepare the vegetables. Rinse the okra under cold water and pat them dry. Trim off the ends and cut them into 1-inch pieces. Peel the onions and chop them into thin slices. Peel the garlic and mince it finely.

Step 3
Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the minced garlic and saut√© it until it turns golden brown. Be careful not to burn the garlic as it can give a bitter taste to the dish.

Step 4
Add the sliced onions to the pan and stir-fry them until they become translucent. This should take about 5 minutes. Then, add the chopped okra to the pan. Continue to stir-fry the vegetables for another 5-7 minutes, or until the okra is cooked to your liking.

Step 5
Finally, add the soy sauce, sugar, and salt to the pan. Stir well to combine all the ingredients and ensure that the okra and onions are well coated with the seasonings. Continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat. Your Okra and Onion Stir Fry is now ready to be served. Enjoy it as a side dish or with a bowl of steamed rice.
