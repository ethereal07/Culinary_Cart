Instructions:

[Step 1]
Start by preparing the marinade. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of thick yogurt, 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste, 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, 1 teaspoon of coriander powder, 1 teaspoon of cumin powder, and salt to taste. Mix all these ingredients well until they form a smooth paste.

[Step 2]
Cut 200 grams of paneer into cubes and add them to the marinade. Also, chop 1 large onion and 1 large bell pepper into cubes and add them to the marinade. Mix well so that the paneer and vegetables are well coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator.

[Step 3]
After the marination time, preheat your grill or oven to 200 degrees Celsius. If you are using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 20 minutes to prevent them from burning.

[Step 4]
Thread the marinated paneer, onion, and bell pepper onto the skewers, alternating between each. Make sure to leave some space between each piece to ensure even cooking. Place the skewers on the grill or in the oven.

[Step 5]
Grill the paneer tikka for about 15-20 minutes, or until the paneer is golden and slightly charred. Make sure to turn the skewers every 5 minutes to ensure even cooking. Once done, remove from the grill or oven and serve hot with mint chutney or any dip of your choice. Enjoy your homemade paneer tikka!
