Step 1
Start by preparing the marinade for the paneer tikka. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of plain yogurt, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 2 teaspoons of turmeric, 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 teaspoon of coriander, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, and salt to taste. Mix all the ingredients until they are well combined.

Step 2
Cut 500 grams of paneer into 1-inch cubes and add them to the marinade. Make sure all the paneer cubes are well coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl and let the paneer marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.

Step 3
Preheat your grill or oven to medium heat. If you're using an oven, preheat it to 200 degrees Celsius or 400 degrees Fahrenheit. While the grill or oven is preheating, thread the marinated paneer cubes onto skewers. If you're using wooden skewers, make sure to soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before using to prevent them from burning.

Step 4
Place the skewers on the grill or in the oven. Cook the paneer tikka for about 15 minutes, turning the skewers occasionally to ensure the paneer is cooked evenly on all sides. The paneer tikka is done when it is golden brown and slightly charred.

Step 5
Remove the paneer tikka from the grill or oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve the paneer tikka with a side of butter for added richness and flavor. You can also serve it with a side of mint chutney or tamarind sauce for a traditional Indian touch. Enjoy your homemade paneer tikka!
