Step 1
Start by washing 250 grams of bhindi (okra) thoroughly under running water. Once washed, pat them dry completely using a kitchen towel. This is important as any moisture can make the bhindi slimy. Once dried, chop the bhindi into 1-inch pieces and set aside.

Step 2
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Then add 1 finely chopped onion to the pan and sauté until it turns golden brown.

Step 3
Next, add 1 teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste to the pan and sauté for another minute until the raw smell goes away. Then add 2 chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft.

Step 4
Now, add the spices - 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1 teaspoon of coriander powder, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook for a minute until the spices are well blended with the onion-tomato mixture.

Step 5
Finally, add the chopped bhindi to the pan and mix well so that the bhindi is well coated with the spices. Cover the pan and let it cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the bhindi is cooked and soft. Once done, garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve hot with roti or rice.
