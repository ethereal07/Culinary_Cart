Step 1: Prepare the Paneer Topping
Start by cutting 200 grams of paneer into small cubes. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a pan over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add 1 teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste and sauté until the raw smell disappears. Add 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, and salt to taste. Mix well and then add the paneer cubes. Sauté the paneer until it is well coated with the spices and set aside.

Step 2: Prepare the Pizza Dough
In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of active dry yeast. Gradually add warm water and knead the mixture into a soft dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

Step 3: Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pizza Base
Preheat your oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit (245 degrees Celsius). Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal parts. Roll out each part into a thin circle on a floured surface. Place the rolled dough onto a greased baking sheet.

Step 4: Assemble the Pizza
Spread a generous amount of pizza sauce over each pizza base. Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Distribute the sautéed paneer evenly over the cheese. Add sliced onions, bell peppers, and olives if desired. Top with another layer of mozzarella cheese.

Step 5: Bake the Pizza
Bake the pizzas in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Remove the pizzas from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade butter paneer pizza!
