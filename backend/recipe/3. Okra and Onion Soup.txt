Step 1
Start by gathering all your ingredients. You will need 1 cup of chopped okra, 1 large onion finely chopped, 4 cups of chicken or vegetable broth, 2 tomatoes finely chopped, 2 cloves of garlic minced, 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 teaspoon of paprika, salt and pepper to taste, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.

Step 2
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté them until they become soft and translucent. This should take about 5 minutes.

Step 3
Next, add the chopped okra to the pot. Continue to sauté for another 5 minutes, until the okra starts to soften. Stir occasionally to prevent the okra from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

Step 4
Add the chopped tomatoes, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper to the pot. Stir well to combine all the ingredients. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the tomatoes start to break down and release their juices.

Step 5
Finally, pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 20 minutes. This will allow all the flavors to meld together. Once the soup is done, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Serve the soup hot, with bread on the side if desired.
