Instructions:
        [Step 1]
        Start by preparing your ingredients. You will need 1 pound of fresh okra (also known as ladies finger), 1 large onion, 4 cups of chicken or vegetable broth, 1 can of diced tomatoes, and your choice of spices such as salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. You will also need some oil for cooking.

        [Step 2]
        Begin by washing the okra thoroughly under running water. Then, cut off the ends and slice the okra into small pieces. Peel and chop the onion into small pieces as well.

        [Step 3]
        Heat a large pot over medium heat and add a tablespoon of oil. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent. This should take about 5 minutes.

        [Step 4]
        Add the sliced okra to the pot and continue to sauté for another 5 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the okra from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

        [Step 5]
        Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, followed by the can of diced tomatoes (including the juice). Stir well to combine all the ingredients. Add your spices at this point - start with a teaspoon of each and adjust to taste.

        [Step 6]
        Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the soup simmer for about 20 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld together and the okra to become tender.

        [Step 7]
        After 20 minutes, check the soup for seasoning and adjust if necessary. Your okra soup is now ready to serve! Enjoy it hot with a side of bread or crackers.
