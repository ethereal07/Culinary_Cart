Step 1
Gather all the necessary ingredients. You will need 200 grams of paneer (cottage cheese), 4 slices of bread, 2 tablespoons of butter, 1 finely chopped onion, 1 finely chopped green chili, 1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1/2 teaspoon of red chili powder, salt to taste, and some fresh coriander leaves.

Step 2
Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the cumin seeds and let them crackle. Then, add the chopped onion and green chili to the pan. Saut√© these ingredients until the onions become translucent.

Step 3
Crumble the paneer into the pan and add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix everything well and cook for about 2-3 minutes. Make sure all the spices are well incorporated with the paneer. Turn off the heat and add the chopped coriander leaves. Mix them well with the paneer.

Step 4
Take one slice of bread and spread a layer of the cooked paneer mixture on it. Place another slice of bread on top to make a sandwich. Repeat this process with the remaining slices of bread and paneer mixture.

Step 5
Heat the remaining tablespoon of butter in a pan over medium heat. Place the sandwiches in the pan and cook until they are golden brown on both sides. Make sure to flip the sandwiches carefully to avoid spilling the paneer filling. Once the sandwiches are well toasted, remove them from the pan. Your Paneer Butter Sandwiches are now ready to be served. Enjoy them while they are still warm.
