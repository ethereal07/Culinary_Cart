Step 1
Start by gathering all your ingredients. You will need 3 eggs, 1/4 cup of milk, salt and pepper to taste, 1 cup of sliced mushrooms, 1/2 cup of your chosen cheese (cheddar, Swiss, or feta), and 2 tablespoons of butter or oil for cooking.

Step 2
In a medium-sized non-stick skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of butter or heat the oil over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté them until they are browned and tender. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Once done, remove the mushrooms from the skillet and set them aside.

Step 3
In a bowl, beat the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together until well combined. Make sure the mixture is smooth and a little frothy. This will help make your omelette fluffy.

Step 4
Reheat the skillet over medium heat and add the remaining tablespoon of butter or oil. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Let it cook without stirring until the edges start to set. This should take about 2-3 minutes.

Step 5
Once the edges of the omelette are set, sprinkle the sautéed mushrooms and cheese over one half of the omelette. Using a spatula, carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the filling. Continue to cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the omelette is cooked to your liking. Slide the omelette onto a plate, cut it in half if desired, and serve immediately. Enjoy your mushroom and cheese omelette!
