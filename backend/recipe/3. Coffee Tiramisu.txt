Ingredients:
- 6 egg yolks
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 2/3 cup milk
- 1 1/4 cups heavy cream
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 8 ounces mascarpone cheese
- 1 cup strong brewed coffee, room temperature
- 2 tablespoons rum (optional)
- 2 packages ladyfinger cookies
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

Instructions:

[Step 1]
In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Boil gently for 1 minute, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Cover tightly and chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.

[Step 2]
In a medium bowl, beat cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form. Whisk mascarpone into yolk mixture until smooth.

[Step 3]
In a small bowl, combine coffee and rum. Split the ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with coffee mixture.

[Step 4]
Arrange half of soaked ladyfingers in bottom of a 7x11 inch dish. Spread half of mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers, then half of whipped cream over that. Repeat layers and sprinkle with cocoa. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours, until set.

[Step 5]
Before serving, dust the top of the dessert with additional cocoa powder. Serve chilled and enjoy your homemade coffee tiramisu.
