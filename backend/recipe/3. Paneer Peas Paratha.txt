Step 1
Start by preparing the dough for the paratha. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of whole wheat flour, a pinch of salt, and 1 tablespoon of oil. Gradually add water and knead the mixture until it forms a soft, pliable dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 20 minutes.

Step 2
While the dough is resting, prepare the stuffing. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and let them sizzle. Then add 1 finely chopped onion and saut√© until it turns golden brown. Add 1 cup of boiled and mashed peas, 1 cup of crumbled paneer (Indian cottage cheese), 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook for a few minutes until the mixture is well combined. Remove from heat and let it cool.

Step 3
Divide the rested dough into equal-sized balls. Take one ball of dough and roll it out into a small circle. Place a spoonful of the paneer and peas mixture in the center of the circle. Bring the edges of the dough together and seal it, making sure the stuffing is completely enclosed. Flatten the stuffed dough ball and roll it out again into a larger circle.

Step 4
Heat a tawa or griddle over medium heat. Place the rolled paratha on the tawa and cook until it starts to bubble. Flip the paratha and cook the other side, applying a little oil or ghee on both sides. Cook until the paratha is golden brown and crispy on both sides. Repeat this process with the remaining dough and stuffing.

Step 5
Serve the Paneer Peas Paratha hot with a side of yogurt or pickle. Enjoy this delicious and filling meal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
