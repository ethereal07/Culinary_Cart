Step 1
Gather all the necessary ingredients for the recipe. You will need 2 cups of heavy cream, 1 cup of whole milk, 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, and 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract.

Step 2
In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the milk and sugar. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar is completely dissolved. This should take about 5 minutes. Be careful not to let the milk boil.

Step 3
Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Add the vanilla extract and mix well until all the ingredients are fully combined. 

Step 4
Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. Once cooled, cover the saucepan and place it in the refrigerator. Let it chill for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.

Step 5
Once the mixture is thoroughly chilled, pour it into an ice cream maker. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for your specific model to churn the mixture into ice cream. This usually takes about 20-25 minutes. Once churned, transfer the ice cream to a lidded container and freeze for at least 4 hours, or until it reaches your desired consistency. Enjoy your homemade vanilla ice cream!
