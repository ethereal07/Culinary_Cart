Ingredients:
- 2 cups of whole milk
- 1 cup of heavy cream
- 1/2 cup of sugar
- 1 tablespoon of gelatin
- 1/2 cup of strong brewed coffee
- Chocolate sauce or cocoa powder for serving

Instructions:
[Step 1]
In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup of the milk. Let it sit for about 5 minutes to soften.

[Step 2]
In a medium saucepan, combine the remaining milk, heavy cream, and sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is hot but not boiling.

[Step 3]
Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the softened gelatin and the coffee to the hot milk mixture. Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved.

[Step 4]
Pour the mixture into six individual serving dishes or one large serving dish. Let it cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until the panna cotta is set and firm to the touch.

[Step 5]
Before serving, drizzle with chocolate sauce or sprinkle with cocoa powder. Enjoy your coffee panna cotta as a delicious end to any meal.
