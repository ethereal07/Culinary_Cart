Instructions:

[Step 1]
Start by preparing all the ingredients. You will need 200 grams of paneer (Indian cottage cheese), 1 large onion finely chopped, 2 medium tomatoes finely chopped, 2 green chilies finely chopped, 1 teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1/2 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala, 2 tablespoons of oil, and salt to taste. 

[Step 2]
Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them crackle for a few seconds. Then, add the chopped onions and green chilies to the pan. Sauté them until the onions become translucent.

[Step 3]
Next, add the ginger-garlic paste to the pan and sauté for another minute until the raw smell of the paste goes away. Then, add the chopped tomatoes, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook this mixture until the tomatoes become soft and mushy.

[Step 4]
While the tomato mixture is cooking, crumble the paneer into small pieces. Once the tomatoes are cooked, add the crumbled paneer to the pan. Mix well so that the paneer is well coated with the tomato mixture. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

[Step 5]
Finally, sprinkle the garam masala over the paneer bhurji and mix well. Cook for another 2 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat. Your paneer bhurji is now ready to be served. Enjoy it hot with bread or roti.
