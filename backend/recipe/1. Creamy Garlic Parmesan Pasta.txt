Step 1
Start by boiling a large pot of salted water. Once the water is boiling, add your pasta of choice. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until it is al dente, or firm to the bite. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.

Step 2
While the pasta is cooking, you can start on the sauce. In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, add 2 cloves of minced garlic and saut√© until it is fragrant, about 1 minute.

Step 3
Next, add 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk to the skillet. Stir the mixture until it is well combined. Allow the mixture to come to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it cook for about 2 minutes.

Step 4
After the cream and milk mixture has simmered, add 1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese to the skillet. Stir the mixture until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a bit more milk until it reaches your desired consistency.

Step 5
Finally, add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Toss the pasta in the sauce until it is fully coated. Season the dish with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the creamy garlic Parmesan pasta hot, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley if desired. Enjoy your meal!
