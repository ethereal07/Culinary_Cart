Step 1
Start by gathering all the necessary ingredients. You will need 2 cups of basmati rice, 1 cup of paneer (cottage cheese), 1 cup of green peas, 2 tablespoons of oil, 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds, 2-3 cloves, 2-3 green cardamoms, 1 cinnamon stick, 1 bay leaf, 1 large onion (finely chopped), 1 teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste, 2 green chilies (slit), salt to taste, and 4 cups of water. 

Step 2
Wash the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain. While the rice is soaking, cut the paneer into small cubes.

Step 3
Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds, cloves, cardamoms, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf. Sauté for a few seconds until the spices release their aroma. Then, add the chopped onion and sauté until it turns golden brown. Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, and sauté for another minute.

Step 4
Add the paneer cubes to the pan and fry until they turn golden brown. Then, add the green peas and sauté for a couple of minutes. Add the drained rice to the pan and gently stir to combine all the ingredients. Add salt to taste.

Step 5
Pour in the water and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and all the water has been absorbed. Fluff the rice gently with a fork before serving. Serve your Paneer Peas Pulao hot with raita or a side salad. Enjoy your meal!
